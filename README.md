4.INSIGHTS s FINDINGS
1.1. Sales Trend Over Months
Monthly totals indicate variation with notable peaks (from dashboard). This suggests seasonality or successful promotions in peak months. Investigate marketing/calendars for the peak months to replicate actions in off-peak months.
2.2. Product Contribution
Latte is the largest revenue contributor. A small set of products (Latte, Americano variants, Cappuccino, Hot Chocolate) drives a significant share of revenue. Prioritize inventory and promotions for these products.
3.3. Time-of-Day Revenue Concentration
Highest revenue is recorded during Night and Afternoon windows, with strong Morning sales. Align staff and prep schedules to peak windows; introduce incentives for low-traffic hours.
4.4. Weekday Pattern
Tuesday is the strongest weekday by revenue (~₹15.1K). Consider weekday-targeted promotions on lower-performing days to smooth weekly demand.
5.5. Average Order Value
AOV (₹31.80) indicates opportunity to increase basket size through bundled offers, add-ons, and loyalty incentives.

and improve service during peaks).
•Introduce two simple bundles (e.g., Latte + Pastry; Americano + Snack) to increase AOV
and test via A/B.
•Run targeted promotions for lower-performing weekdays and measure lift (use discount codes or time-limited offers).
•Pilot a basic loyalty mechanism (digital or physical) to increase repeat purchases and
collect customer data for segmentation.
•Capture additional transaction metadata (campaign tag, order channel, customer
segment) for richer analysis.
•Perform monthly reviews of five KPIs: Total Sales, Orders, AOV, Top 3 Products, Peak
Hours.
